* pwsafe_adapter [[https://travis-ci.org/jorenvo/pwsafe-adapter][file:https://travis-ci.org/jorenvo/pwsafe-adapter.svg?branch=master]]
A program that sits between [[https://github.com/nsd20463/pwsafe][pwsafe]] and [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging][WebExtensions native
messaging]]. Meant to be used in conjunction with pwsafe-ff (TODO add
github/mdn link when published).
** Description
This allows a browser extension to communicate with pwsafe using the
native messaging API. The browser extension starts this program and
sends the following to stdin:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
\x2d\x00\x00\x00{"password": "pwd", "website": "mozilla.org"}
#+END_EXAMPLE

This program will open pwsafe for the =mozilla.org= website and then
sends =pwd\n= to its stdin. It will then read the reply sent over its
stdout and encode it before sending it back to the browser extension:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
\x40\x00\x00\x00{"password": "mozilla_password", "username": "mozilla_username"}
#+END_EXAMPLE

See the [[tests/acceptance_tests.sh][acceptance tests]] for more examples.
